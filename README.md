# Dynamic Route Optimization and Emission Reduction System

## 💡 Introduction

**Problem Statement**: Optimizing vehicle routes to ensure timely deliveries while minimizing environmental impact is a significant challenge in logistics and transportation. Our project addresses this issue through a dynamic routing system that integrates real-time traffic, weather, and vehicle data.

**Solution**: This solution uses a Python-based backend with Flask and a Flutter-based frontend in Dart. The system connects multiple APIs, including TomTom, Google Maps, AQICN, and OSRM, to recommend efficient routes and estimate vehicle emissions. It aims to enhance delivery efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce carbon footprints, promoting sustainability in logistics.
